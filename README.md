# LB8CG Antennas

In this repository, I would like to share antenna models that I hope will be useful for the ham radio community.

## Subfolder contents:

./dxpeak_vertical - MMANA-GAL models for the family of 3-band trapped vertical antennas. Models for different band combinations and supporting pole heights are provided. Please visit dxpeak.com for antenna implementation tips and real antenna measurement results.
